	Network section allows you configure ports Siter uses as well as set up HTTPS.
	It is recommended to leave the default port numbers: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS to avoid explicitly specifying
	ports in your website's URL.
</p>
<p>
	For HTTPS you have a few controls: HTTPS checkbox, redirect checkbox and input fields for certificate and key files.
	To start using HTTPS, first enable HTTPS mode with the first checkbox and copy the paths of certificate and key files.
	After that, save the settings and click the redirect checkbox. This is essential since Siter is now available over
	both HTTP and HTTPS. Siter will check whether HTTPS is set up correctly and prevent you from enabling redirect
	if it isn't since you could lose access to Siter. Once set up correctly, click save button one more time to
	disable access over HTTP.
