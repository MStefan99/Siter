<p>
	Analytics section here is similar to app analytics options, except the analytics will be collected about Siter
	itself instead of whatever website you are hosting.
</p>
<p>
	Analytics allows you to collect valuable information about Siter and detect various problems early.
	Siter seamlessly integrates with Crash Course to collect performance data, audience, frontend and backend logs.
</p>
<p>
	To set up and start using analytics, you will need to fill in three things: the URL of your Crash Course instance
	and two keys: audience key and telemetry key. You can get all of these from Crash Course. If you are using Siter to
	host Crash Course locally, use a loop-back IP address to avoid connection issues.
