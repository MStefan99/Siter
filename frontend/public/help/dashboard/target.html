	Hosting target determines what an app should serve when a request has been received.
</p>
<p>
	Target can be one of two things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Local directory</li>
	<li>Web server (either local or remote)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To host static files from a given directory, just choose <b>directory</b> as the
	target and pick a directory to be served.
	If you are using an SPA (single-page application), you can enable the SPA mode.
	This will adjust the routing to serve your application and avoid 404 errors.
</p>
<p>
	If you have an existing web server that you want to use, choose
	<b>web server</b>. In this case an app will act as a proxy, forwarding the
	requests to the server and serving its responses back to the users.
	The server can be remote or local but using an app as
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a>
	is generally recommended.
</p>
<p>
	If your backend is available on a domain different from your frontend, you need to use a CORS section.
	Here you will find a list of domains allowed to access your backend. If a request is coming from a matching
	domain, an app will add a CORS header even if it isn't supported by the target server.
