	This section tells you whether the Siter web server is functioning properly. The purpose of the server is to
	serve client requests by either sending static files or forwarding them to the destination servers depending on the
	configuration.
	There are three possible options:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Green</b>, server is available and working properly</li>
	<li><b>Yellow</b>, server is available but not functioning properly</li>
	<li><b>Red</b>, server unavailable</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If there are any problems with the server, you will see a message with
	possible steps for solving the problem.
