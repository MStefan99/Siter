	Process manager allows you to skip the trouble of setting up an external process manager such as PM2 and forever
	and start your website server (or any other executable file on your computer) without leaving Siter.
</p>
<p>
	Adding a process is pretty self-explanatory: you need to specify an application to run (for example, <code>node</code>
	or <code>python</code>, can also be empty), a file to use (like a location of your Node.js entry file or your
	executable),
	flags/CLI parameters and environment variables to use.
</p>
<p>
	There are some environment variables that are sometimes added to every process and cannot be edited. These include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>PATH - Similar to PATH variable on your computer.</li>
	<li>
		PORT - specifies which port your server should use.
		Port number is taken from the Target section when target is a web server. Needs server support.
	</li>
	<li>
		CRASH_COURSE_URL - URL of a Crash Course instance for the server to use. The address is taken from analytics
		section. Needs server support.
	</li>
	<li>
		CRASH_COURSE_AUDIENCE_KEY - Audience key to be used with Crash Course instance. The key is taken from analytics
		section. Needs server support.
	</li>
	<li>
