	Analytics allows you to collect valuable information about your website and detect various problems early.
	Siter seamlessly integrates with Crash Course to collect performance data and server-side logs. If your website
	supports auto configuration via environment variables, frontend analytics will be also enabled, allowing you to
	view your website's audience, frontend logs and collect user feedback.

	To set up and start using analytics, you will need to fill in three things: the URL of your Crash Course instance
	and two keys: audience key and telemetry key. You can get all of these from Crash Course. If you are using Siter to
	host Crash Course locally, use a loop-back IP address to avoid connection issues.
