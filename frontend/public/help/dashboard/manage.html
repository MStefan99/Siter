	Siter Dashboard is a convenient tool for managing apps. To create a new app just click the
	<b>Add app</b> button and fill in your desired app options. You can change app settings by clicking the pen
	icon in the top right corner of the app card and delete the app using a trash bin icon. If you have enabled
	process manager in app settings, you can use the reload icon to restart all processes started by an app.
	When you click the save button, all changes are saved and applied immediately. You can drag and drop app cards to
	change the order of apps.
