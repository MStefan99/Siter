	Apps is where all the magic happens. An "application" here is a logical unit that serves content
	for the incoming requests. An app can not only receive and serve client requests but also launch and monitor
	the status of other processes on your device and forward the logs and performance data of your server
	for further analysis. You can configure your app to use HTTPS to encrypt sensitive information
	and allowed CORS origins for extra security.
</p>
<p>
	Each app has a filter for incoming requests and will only serve a request if the request URL has matched
	its own filter. If no app was able to process the incoming request, Siter will return a 404 error.
</p>
<p>
	When Siter receives a request, it will check whether each of the apps app can handle the request,
	starting from the first. When a first suitable app is found the content will be served according to the app's
	settings.
