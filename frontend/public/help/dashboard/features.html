<p>
	Siter apps have three features that you can enable independently: hosting, process manager and analytics.
	Hosting allows the app to handle incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests. Process manager is used to start other processes,
	such as your own website servers. Process manager will run the specified commands when Siter starts
	and restart them if the process exits, making sure they run continuously. Analytics feature integrates with
	Crash Course to save valuable insights about your website: audience, client/server logs, system performance
	and user feedback.
