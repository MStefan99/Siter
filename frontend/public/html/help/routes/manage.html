	Siter Dashboard is a convenient tool for managing routes on your server.
	To add a route, just click <b>Add route</b> button and fill in your desired
	route options. When you submit the route, it will be saved and enabled
	immediately.
</p>
<p>
	Every Siter route (except for the default one) will have two icons:
	<b>edit</b> and <b>remove</b>. Pressing the edit button will open the popup
	where you can edit the route options and pressing the remove icon will
	remove the route and disable it.
