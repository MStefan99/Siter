	Route target determines what Siter should serve when a request for a given
	route has been received.
</p>
<p>
	Siter target can be one of two things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A directory</li>
	<li>Another web server</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To host static files from a given directory, just choose <b>directory</b> as the
	target and paste the directory path to be served. Siter will automatically
	find the correct
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">media type</a>
	based on the file extension and send it along with the file.
</p>
<p>
	If you have an existing web server that you want to use with Siter, choose
	<b>web server</b>. In this case Siter will act as a proxy, forwarding the
	requests to the server and serving its responses back to the users.
	The server can be remote or local but using Siter as
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a>
	is generally recommended.
