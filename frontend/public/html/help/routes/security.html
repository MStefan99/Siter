	Hosting your sites over HTTP is not recommended since it has no security and
	the data sent via HTTP could be visible for other users. Using HTTP is only
	recommended for testing purposes.

	To enable HTTPS, a secure version of HTTP, check the <b>Enable HTTPS</b>
	checkbox when creating or editing a route. You will need to get a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">certificate</a>
	to serve your site over HTTPS. Certificate authority will usually provide
	you with two files: a certificate file and a key file. Save these files on your
	server and paste file paths into the corresponding fields.
	You should use an absolute path in the format used by your operating system.
