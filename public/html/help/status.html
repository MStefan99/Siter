<p>
	Siter consists of two parts: <b>a server</b> running on your device and
	<b>a web interface</b> which you're using now.
	These parts are independent so this section tells you whether the Siter
	web server is functioning properly.
	There are <b>three</b> possible statuses:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Green</b>, server is available and working properly</li>
	<li><b>Yellow</b>, server is available but not functioning properly</li>
	<li><b>Red</b>, server unavailable</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If there are any problems with the server, you will see a message with
	possible steps for solving the problem.
