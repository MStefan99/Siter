<p>
	Knowing what routes are is extremely important for any Siter user. They are the
	foundation of Siter and are needed for any configuration. Even the web interface
	you see right now is using a route.
</p>
<p>
	<b>A route</b> in Siter is a term that describes a single endpoint on your server.
	Upon receiving a request, Siter will find the route that matches the given request
	and return the resource that the route points to.
</p>
<p>
	A route includes three main parts: a <b>URL mask</b> needed to select
	which route to use, a <b>target</b> telling Siter which resource
	it should serve and <b>security</b> for protecting your server.
</p>
<p>
	When Siter receives a request, it will check every added route one by one,
	in the order they are presented here. After a first matching route is found,
	Siter stops the search and serves the content according to the route target.
