	To help you further understand how routes work, let's imagine
	the following scenario: you have two applications and you'd like to
	host them on a single server using Siter. The first application is a
	<b>blog app</b> and the second one is a <b>file sharing app</b> similar
	to Google Drive. In addition to these apps you'd also like to host
	public files from the file sharing app (let's call it a "Drive").
</p>
<p>
	First you would add the route for your blog. The domain will
	be <b>"blog"</b> and port and prefix will use the default values.
	Set the target to server and use address according to your blog settings.
</p>
<p>
	Then you would add a route for hosting files. <b>Remember: more
	specific rules come first.</b> To do this, create a route with domain
	<b>"drive"</b>, prefix <b>"public"</b> and a default port.
	Make sure that the Drive does not also use this prefix.
	Set target to the directory containing public files of the Drive.
</p>
<p>
	Finish by adding the route for the Drive app the same way as you did
	for the blog, but replace the domain with <b>"drive"</b>.
	If needed, you can rearrange routes by dragging them.
</p>
<p>Now your routes should look like this (note the order):</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>blog.example.com:80/</b> for your blog</li>
	<li><b>drive.example.com:80/public/</b> for your public files</li>
	<li><b>drive.example.com:80/</b> for the Drive app</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This way for your users the last two routes <b>seem to be connected</b>
	despite the fact that the second route is not even forwarded
	to the Drive app.
</p>
<p>
	Now you just need to secure your routes and the setup is ready to use!
