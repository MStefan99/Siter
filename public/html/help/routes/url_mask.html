<p>
	URL mask determines which route to choose for a request that Siter receives.
	The mask itself consists of three parts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A subdomain</li>
	<li>A port</li>
	<li>And a prefix</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To understand what they are for, let's take this URL as an example:
	<b>http://service1.example.com:80/category1/page1/</b>.
</p>
<p>
	In this example, <b>service1.example.com</b> is a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domain name</a>
	of your website, the "name" by which your website is available on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
	<b>example.com</b> is called a root domain. Currently Siter
	does not support route domain routing so this part is ignored
	when serving requests.
</p>
<p>
	Our URL starts with a <b>service1</b>. This is a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain">subdomain</a>. Subdomains are
	a part of a domain name and are made to separate different services
	on your website.
</p>
<p>
	The part after the domain is called a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a>
	and in our example it is <b>80</b>.
	Different ports could be used to host multiple websites on a single server
	but usually they are set to a default value used by all browsers and
	a subdomain is used instead.
</p>
<p>
	Our example URL ends in <b>/category1/page1/</b>. You can think of it as a file
	path that user requests. Here <b>/category1/</b> acts like a directory which
	can have multiple files inside it, though they might not always be actual files
	on a server.
</p>
<p>
	You can configure Siter to use a prefix for routing requests
	to a different target. For example, a request to <b>website.com/shop/</b>
	could be routed differently than a request to just <b>website.com</b>.
</p>
<p>
	Note that a prefix is removed when serving requests, so a request to
	<b>website.com/shop/product1.html</b> with <b>/shop/</b> prefix
	will look for <b>/product1.html</b> on your server.
</p>
<b>Be extremely careful when using route prefixes!</b>
<p>
	While route prefixes are a convenient way to separate routes, using them
	might have some unwanted consequences. Before adding a prefix
	you have to make sure your top-level website <b>is not already using</b> it
	(for example, there is no /shop/ section on website.com).
	Also if your target is not using links relative to a current directory
	(ones starting with "./") then <b>such links might break</b> when trying to
	host them on a route with prefix. In such cases you might want to
	use a <b>subdomain</b> instead.
