## What is Siter?
Originally planned to be a web interface for Apache, Siter has since become
a standalone application you can use to easily set up your web server to
host a variety of things. You can configure Siter to serve static files,
be a reverse proxy or both at the same time. The main goal of Siter is to
make setting up servers easy and streamlined, whether you just need to
host a single application you made yourself or dozens of web servers
used by a lot of people. Siter was designed to be fast and reliable,
features an easy-to-use web interface and can be set up in minutes!

## Installation
- Install Node.js
- Run `setup.sh`
- Run `node app.js`
- Open [Siter Dashboard][dashboard] and use `admin` as the password. Don't forget to change the password in settings

## Getting started
Siter Dashboard is made to be simple and easy to use. But if you still have
some trouble configuring Siter, a **Help** section on every page 
will help you better understand how all the options work, provide you
with examples on using them and give some tips on which of them 
to use in your case.  
You can also view help pages in HTML format [here][help].
